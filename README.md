# Java âœ¨
* Welcome to my Daily Java Learning Log! 
This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey as I commit to learning something new about Java every day. 
Each commit represents a new concept, feature or technique I've explored, along with examples and notes. 
# Purpose ðŸš€ðŸš€

**The main goal of this repository is to:**

* Track my progress and learning over time
* Share knowledge and insights with others
* Create a personal reference for future projects
